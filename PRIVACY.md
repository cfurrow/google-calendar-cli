# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 12, 2025

**Last Updated:** June 12, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Google Calendar CLI Application ("the Application," "we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our service to access and format your Google Calendar data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

### Google Calendar Data
When you authorize the Application to access your Google Calendar, we temporarily process the following data:
- Calendar event dates
- Event start times
- Event titles
- Event durations (calculated in minutes)

### Information We Do NOT Collect
We do not collect, access, store, or process:
- Your name or personal identification information
- Your email address
- Contact information from your Google account
- Calendar event descriptions or detailed content
- Location data from calendar events
- Attendee information
- Any other personal data from Google services beyond the specific calendar fields listed above

## How We Use Your Information

### Data Processing
The Application processes your Google Calendar data exclusively for the following purpose:
- Converting Google Calendar API responses into markdown-formatted unordered lists
- Generating local output containing only event dates, start times, titles, and durations

### Local Processing Only
All data processing occurs entirely on your local computer. The Application:
- Fetches JSON data directly from Google Calendar API to your device
- Processes this data locally using software running on your machine
- Outputs formatted markdown lists directly to your local system
- Does not transmit your calendar data to any external servers or third parties

## Data Storage and Retention

### No Data Storage
We do not store any of your information. Specifically:
- No calendar events are saved to databases or files
- No personal information is retained after processing
- No cached copies of your data are maintained
- All data exists only temporarily in your device's memory during processing

### Data Retention Period
Since we do not store any data, there is no retention period. Your information is processed and immediately discarded after generating the markdown output.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### No Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your information to any third parties. The Application:
- Operates entirely offline after initial API authentication
- Does not transmit data to external servers
- Does not use third-party analytics or tracking services
- Does not share data with advertising networks or data brokers

### Google API Compliance
Our use of Google Calendar API data is strictly limited to the stated functionality and complies with Google's API Terms of Service and Privacy Policy requirements.

## Security Measures

### Local Processing Security
Since all processing occurs on your local device:
- Your data never leaves your computer except for the direct Google API connection
- No intermediate servers or services handle your information
- Standard OAuth 2.0 authentication protects your Google account access
- API tokens are managed according to Google's security requirements

## Your Rights and Choices

### Access Control
You maintain full control over your data:
- You can revoke the Application's access to your Google Calendar at any time through your Google Account settings
- You can stop using the Application without any data cleanup requirements since no data is stored
- Your Google Calendar data remains under your direct control

### Data Portability
Since we do not store your data, traditional data portability concepts do not apply. You can access your original calendar data directly through Google Calendar at any time.

## Third-Party Services

### Google Services
This Application uses Google Calendar API to access your calendar data. Your use of Google services is also governed by Google's Privacy Policy, which can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

### No Other Third Parties
We do not integrate with, share data with, or rely on any other third-party services beyond Google Calendar API.

## Children's Privacy

This Application is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Since we do not collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

## Contact Information

This is a personal project for individual use. If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you may review the documentation in this repository or discontinue use of the Application.

## Compliance

This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws and Google's API Terms of Service. Our data handling practices are intentionally minimal to protect your privacy and reduce compliance complexity.

---

**Summary:** We do not store any of your information. The Application fetches your Google Calendar data, processes it locally on your computer, and outputs only basic event information (date, time, title, duration) as markdown lists. Your data never leaves your device except for the direct connection to Google's servers.
