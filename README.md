# Google Calendar CLI Application

## Overview

This repository serves as a documentation placeholder for a Google Cloud Application designed to retrieve calendar events from Google Calendar and output them as markdown lists.

## Important Notice

**This repository contains no code and is not intended to contain any code in the future.** This is strictly a documentation repository created to satisfy Google's application requirements for API access.

## Purpose

This documentation repository exists solely to meet Google's requirements for applications that access Google Calendar API. The actual application runs locally on individual user machines and is not distributed through this repository.

## What This Repository Contains

- Documentation files (README.md, PRIVACY.md, TERMS.md)
- No executable code
- No installation instructions
- No dependencies

## What This Repository Does NOT Contain

- Source code
- Installation packages
- Deployment scripts
- Configuration files
- Any executable components

## Application Functionality

The actual Google Calendar CLI application (which runs separately from this repository) performs the following functions:

- Connects to Google Calendar API
- Retrieves calendar events for authorized users
- Processes calendar data locally on the user's machine
- Outputs calendar events as formatted markdown lists
- Operates entirely on the user's local system

## Data Processing

All calendar data processing occurs locally on the user's machine. No data is stored, transmitted, or processed through any external servers or services beyond the direct Google Calendar API connection.

## Privacy and Security

For detailed information about data handling, privacy practices, and security measures, please refer to the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

## Terms of Service

For information about the terms governing this repository and any future applications, please refer to the [Terms of Service](TERMS.md).
